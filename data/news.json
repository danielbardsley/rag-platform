	{"text": "headline: NFL Week 8 Power Rankings: Ravens catapult into top 3 after demolishing Lions, Steelers also make huge leap. article: We've been waiting for the Baltimore Ravens' new-look passing attack to show up this season, an attack that would feature Lamar Jackson throwing it all over the field to a new group of pass-catchers who would light up the scoreboard. We finally saw it Sunday. Jackson proved he can and will flourish in first-year coordinator Todd Monken's system, one that was supposed to display a better downfield passing attack. But heading into Sunday's impressive blowout of the Detroit Lions, it seemed to be missing something on a weekly basis. Whether it was turnovers by Jackson or the many drops by the receivers, the consistency wasn't there. But it was there in a big way against the Lions as Jackson was outstanding. He threw for a season-best 357 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. He ran nine times for 36 yards and a touchdown, but the rushing total was his second lowest this season. Jackson completed 21 of his 27 passes and averaged 15.1 per attempt. That's special stuff. The Ravens scored touchdowns on their first four possessions to blow open the game early."},

That didn't change on Monday night, as the Vikings pulled out a 22-17 victory at home on Monday Night Football. The Vikings got out to an early lead, and the 49ers found themselves playing catch-up all game long. Despite cutting the deficit down to five twice in the contest, San Francisco was unable to claw its way back, dropping its seventh consecutive game in Minnesota. Quarterback Kirk Cousins was excellent for Kevin O'Connell's crew, even without star wide receiver Justin Jefferson, who is sidelined with a hamstring injury. The Minnesota signal caller threw for 378 yards, two touchdowns and an interception to improve to 3-4 on the year. In Jefferson's absence, rookie WR Jordan Addison and TE T.J. Hockenson stepped up in the passing game. Addison hauled in seven catches for 123 yards and two touchdowns, including a 60-yard TD to end the first half. Hockenson brought in 11 catches for 86 yards. The offensive line was arguably the biggest factor of the day, as the Minnesota unit did not allow a single sack all day. San Francisco dropped to 5-2, losing its second-straight game after the loss to Cleveland last week. The offense was unable to make up for the absence of wide receiver Deebo Samuel, who was out with a hamstring injury. Quarterback Brock Purdy threw for 272 yards, but only found the end zone once and was picked off twice. Both of those interceptions were by Vikings cornerback Camryn Bynum, who shined on defense. He led all Minnesota defenders with nine total tackles, seven solo tackles, two pass deflections and the two interceptions."},
	{"text": "headline: The State of the 2023 Patriots: Accountability Check. article: If you feel like you’ve seen this article on this site before, don’t worry; there’s no glitch in The Matrix. I last posted a New England Patriots accountability check back in October of 2021 when the team sat at 1-3 and had just released Stephon Gilmore. The first time I posted it was all the way back in 2018, when the would-be Super Bowl champion Patriots sat at 1-2 after an embarrassing loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars and everyone thought the team was done. I wanted to see if folks were willing to put their money where their mouths were, make a prediction about the state of the team, and revisit those comments at the season’s end. Everyone was so low on the Patriots during those moments, I thought it would be an interesting experiment, and it was more or less successful; the articles received a ton of comments and people seemed to enjoy the receipts I presented at the end of the season. Some of you were spot on, others were way off, and a few more have likely long checked into the nuthouse by now. Given the past success of those articles, I thought I’d try something a little different this time around. Rather than post an accountability check on the heels of a crushing loss, I thought I’d do it coming off of a seemingly rare feel-good win. The Patriots just took down the Buffalo Bills and showed some real signs of life for the first time in a long time. There’s optimism around the team for once. So it’s time to ask how Patriots Nation feels right now. Has this team turned the corner? Or was Sunday’s win just a small blip on the Failed Season Express? How do you feel about the 2023 Patriots and where they’ll be come January?Now is your chance to definitively state where you think this team will end up once the season ends. If you think New England can claw their way back and finish with a respectable record, let us know. If you still don’t see them notching more than four wins, make the call below. If you’re starkly terrified of commitment and want to hedge your bets with a, “Let’s see how they perform this week before making any real judgment waffle, go for it. Later on this year, Ill take some of the comments that I think represent a good cross-section of how everyone is feeling, post them up for all to see, and give you the opportunity to crow over how right you were, or eat crow over how wrong you were. Just so we’re clear: by commenting on this article, you hereby give Pats Pulpit your full permission to have that comment posted in an article I will put up at the end of the season in which I see who was right and who was wrong. If you were correct, you’ll be acknowledged for it. If you were way off, be willing to face the music. Fans of other teams are more than welcome as well - just be ready for the potential consequences of accountability. So have at it. What can we expect from this team once the season is over? Where will the Patriots end up?"}
